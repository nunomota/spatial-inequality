def greedily_pick_redistricting_moves(district, lookup, min_schools_per_district, max_schools_per_district):
    &#34;&#34;&#34;
    Greedily calculates all schools that should be redistricted from a selected
    district to one of its neighbors, such that the whole neighborhood&#39;s
    inequality is reduced.

    To do this, this function arbitrarily iterates over all schools at the
    selected district&#39;s border (with its neighboring districts) and evaluates
    whether a given move would be a good (local) move or not. It does this by:
    (i) &#39;virtually&#39; redistricting the school to another potential district; and
    (ii) comparing both districts&#39; per-student funding after this move was made.
    If funding is closer between the districts, the move is registered and the
    overall iteration process proceeds. Otherwise, the move is reverted before
    proceeding.

    Args:
        district (optimization.entity_nodes.District): Target District to redistrict
            schools from.
        lookup (optimization.lookup.Lookup): Lookup instance for fast information
            querying.
        min_schools_per_district (int): Minimum number of schools to preserve in
            each district, upon redistricting. A number equal to (or lesser than)
            zero will allow districts to merge.
        max_schools_per_district (int): Maximum number of schools to be preserved in
            each district, upon redistricting.

    Returns:
        list of tuple: List of all greedy School redistricting moves that would
            reduce the selected District neighborhood&#39;s inequality (i.e., tuples
            comprised of a redistricted school&#39;s standardized NCES ID, its source
            district&#39;s standardized NCES ID and its destination district&#39;s
            standardized NCES ID).

    Performs all registered greedy moves and updates both

    according to the new school/district assignments.

    NOTE: Since some of the districts involved in the registered moves may have
    been moved to the holdout queue, updating the lazy heap may raise a KeyError
    exception. In this case, it&#39;s safe to skip this step as it will not
    interfere with the heap&#39;s order.

    Args:
        target_state (str): Capitalized full state name (e.g., &#39;Alabama&#39;).
        aug_school_info (pandas.DataFrame): Target augmented school information

        school_assignment (pandas.DataFrame): Target school assignment (as
            formatted by `auxiliary.data_handler.DataHandler`).
        min_schools_per_district (int): Minimum number of schools to preserve in
            each district, upon redistricting. A number equal to (or lesser
            than) zero will allow districts to merge.
        max_schools_per_district (int): Maximum number of schools to be
            preserved in each district, upon redistricting.
        early_stopper_it (int): Number of allowed iterations without improvement

        early_stopper_tol (float): Tolerance for floating point inequality
            improvement measurement.

            be called - by key - at specific stages of the algorithm&#39;s
            execution. &#39;on_init&#39; will be called once, right after variables&#39;
            initialization and before any computation takes place. &#39;on_update&#39;
            will be called at the beginning of every iteration of the algorithm.
            &#39;on_end&#39; will be called once, right before the algorithm terminates
            its execution and after all computations are done. &#39;on_move&#39; will be
            called whenever greedy school redistricting moves are made, right
            after they are applied. Each callback will then be passed
            corresponding arguments, regarding the status of execution. More
            specifically, &#39;on_init&#39;, &#39;on_update&#39;, and &#39;on_end&#39; will have access
            to (i) the list of all `optimization.entity_nodes.School` instances,
            (ii) the list of all `optimization.entity_nodes.District` instances,
            and (iii) an updated `optimization.lookup.Lookup` instance. On the
            other hand, &#39;on_move&#39; will only be passed (i) the current
            iteration&#39;s index, and (ii) the list of all moves that were

    Performs multiple runs of the greedy partitioning algorithm for a given
    state, to get an &#39;expectation&#39; of its performance and measure uncertainty
    associated with the spatial inequality index&#39;s minimization process. It then
    extracts a single &#39;expectable&#39; run (alongside benchmarking statistics) and
    returns them.

    NOTE: Parallelizing iterations over the same state would be possible to
    speedup this benchmarking process.

    Args:
        target_state (str): Capitalized full state name (e.g., &#39;Alabama&#39;).
        aug_school_info (pandas.DataFrame): Target augmented school information
            (as formatted by `auxiliary.data_handler.DataHandler`).
        school_assignment (pandas.DataFrame): Target school assignment (as
            formatted by `auxiliary.data_handler.DataHandler`).
        n_runs (int): Number of runs to perform for the greedy partitioning
            algorithm.
        greedy_params (kwargs): Keyword arguments for the greedy partitioning
            algorithm&#39;s parameterization. Two values can be specified through

            &#39;max_schools_per_district&#39;. These respectively refer to the minimum
            and maximum number of schools to preserve in each district, upon
            redistricting.
        early_stopper_params (kwargs): Keyword arguments for the early stopper&#39;s
            parameterization. Two values can be specified through this
            parameter, namely (i) &#39;early_stopper_it&#39; and (ii)

    Greedily calculates all schools that should be redistricted from a selected
