Welcome to the documentation of the Spatial Inequality Index! This package was first published as part of our publication at The Web Conference 2021, [Fair Partitioning of Public Resources: Redrawing District Boundary to Minimize Spatial Inequality in School Funding](https://nunomota.github.io/assets/papers/www2021.pdf).

If you landed here by mistake and simply want to see our algorithm in action, you can instead visit our [interactive website](http://redistricting.mpi-sws.org). For anyone interested in contributing to this codebase, feel free to open a pull-request (or an issue) on our [GitHub](https://github.com/nunomota/spatial-inequality) repository. Also, an in-depth description of the whole algorithm (alongside its temporal complexity) can be found as a README at [the package's source code directory](https://github.com/nunomota/spatial-inequality/tree/master/spatial_inequality).
