In this repository, we include all the necessary code to calculate the Spatial Inequality Index. This code was provided as part of our publication at The Web Conference 2021, [Fair Partitioning of Public Resources: Redrawing District Boundary to Minimize Spatial Inequality in School Funding](https://nunomota.github.io/assets/papers/www2021.pdf).

For anyone interested in using (or contributing to) our codebase, we provide complete [documentation](https://nunomota.github.io/spatial-inequality/src/) on all of our modules. For anyone otherwise interested in visualizing the impact of our algorithm in school redistricting, we also provide an [interactive website](http://redistricting.mpi-sws.org).
